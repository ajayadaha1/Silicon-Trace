## Usage

### Upload Excel or PowerPoint Files

1. Navigate to the **"File Manager"** tab (formerly "Ingest Data")
2. Click **"Browse files"** or drag and drop files
3. Select one or multiple files (supports .xlsx, .xls, .pptx)
4. Click **"Process Files"**

**Supported File Types:**
- **Excel (.xlsx, .xls)**: Standard Excel workbooks with tables
- **PowerPoint (.pptx)**: Presentations with failure data in tables, text, or images

**PowerPoint Support:**
The system uses a multi-phase extraction approach:
- **Phase 1 - Native Tables**: Extracts data from PowerPoint tables (fast, most accurate)
- **Phase 2 - Text Extraction**: Parses text boxes for "SERIAL (ERROR)" patterns
- **Phase 3 - OCR Fallback**: Uses Optical Character Recognition for image-based content (requires pytesseract)

The parser will:
- Detect which columns contain serial numbers
- Skip large reference sheets (>2000 rows)
- Skip sheets named "datecode", "sheet1", "lookup", etc.
- Combine data from multiple sheets within each file
- **Merge data from multiple files** if serial numbers overlap
- Normalize column names to handle case/spacing differences
- Track source sheet, row, and file for each entry
- Prevent duplicate file uploads

**Multi-File Merging Example**:
- File1.xlsx has serial "ABC123" with "FA status": "Closed as known issue"
- File2.xlsx has same serial "ABC123" with "FA status": "8/7: Scan failed..."
- Result: One record with "FA status": "Closed as known issue | 8/7: Scan failed..."
- Metadata shows: `_files_combined: "File1.xlsx | File2.xlsx"`
